## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.

- seattle_airbnb.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate trends of bookings on Airbnb in the year 2016 in Seattle.
- utility.py           ==> Python helper functions, they are used in the notebook.
- calendar.csv         ==> Booking information of houses in Seattle.
- listings.csv         ==> Information of houses in Seattle.
- reviews.csv          ==> Reviews of houses in Seattle.

## Results
The most popular house size in Seattle are houses for 6 or 10 persons. Tourist prefer to rent an entire house over a private room and a shared room. Having a strict cancellation policy leads to reduced interest of clients. Seattle is the most popular around the turn of the year.
